# CustomGameLauncher
this is a custom Game Launcher (WIP)
This was a project that I wanted to start as I dont feel adding all of my games or other EXE files that I use to steam for ease of access so I tried to create a python program that can have a custom background and upload EXE files to while also extracting the Icons from the EXE files but that is also where some of the issue is it is supposed to automatically resize the icon file to the button to launch the EXE file in the game launcher but it doesn't and the grid does not do what I was trying to have it does which was make it where when the buttons reaches the maximum number next to eachother it would go down a row without resizing the buttons but when you refresh the game list it tends to make it where it is 4 in a row then it goes down anyone who wants to help with this can and I would greatly appreciate it I will include pictures of some of the features that it has so you can see if you would like to help or if you think it is a lost cause as I know there are other software and programs like this out there already.
